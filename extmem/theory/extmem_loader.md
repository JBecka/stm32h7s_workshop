# External memory loader (extmem_loader)

This is a project which will be used with IDE/STM32CubeProgrammer to load a Application into external memory. 

If case you have unique board or new memory you must create memory loader for this combination. 

We can create loader for:
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32CubeProgrammer
- IAR
- Keil
